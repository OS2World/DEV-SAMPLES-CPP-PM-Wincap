wincap.exe
----------

This is a Presentation Manager utility to copy window/desktop contents to a
bitmap. It is based on IBM Visual Age C++. You can select either a window or a
rectangular area on desktop. If a window is selected the contents inside the
window rectangle are copied.

Use "File-Select Window" or "File-Select Area" menu option to start selection.

If "File-Select Window" is selected, windows on desktop will be selected as
mouse is moved over the screen. Move the mouse pointer to the desired window
and press mouse button1 to select. If "File-Select Area" is selected, choose
a rectangular area on the desktop by dragging mouse button1.

Use "File-Save Bitmap" to save the bitmap to a BMP file.

Menu items under "Options" can be checked on/off to set wincap window options.
Select "Options-Hide Before Select" to hide the wincap window before selecting
a bitmap.
Select "Options-Activate Selected Win" to activate the window under mouse
pointer when a window is being selected.
Select "Options-Stretch To Fit" to expand/shrink the selected bitmap to wincap
window size. (If you want to save the bitmap with this size, start another
instance of wincap and copy contents of the previous instance in the new wincap
window.)
